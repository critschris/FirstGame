  Name: Hero's Blade
  Description: This is a sword fit for a hero. Which is DEFINATELY NOT what you are.
    But it has decent stats so... yeah. The folk lore tells the tale of an old hero
    that once used the blade to slay an unspeakable horror in the pixel realm. After
    the Horror was defeated, he returned to his dimension. You note that this is
    just a Isekai plot and deduct the that the writer is very lazy.
